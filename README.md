# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
 
### Purpose
This analysis is for a friend who is looking for financial advice on what stocks to invest in. We looked at the performance of the stocks over the course of 2018 to determine their overall performance for the year. We wrote a VBA script so that he wouldn't have to install developer tools or even do more than press a button so that he could use this tool in the future.

## Results

### Initial Script

### Second Script

## Summary

Refactoring the code cut the processing time immensely. However, because of my misunderstanding of the instructions, finding what went wrong took FAR longer than the single second of difference was worth. In a larger data-set, or a script that would be used over and over again by numerous people every day, that increased efficiency might be worth the work, but in this case, a 1 to 2 second difference whenever my friend feels like checking some stocks is not worth the 2 hours I spent (not to mention the frustration) trying to figure out exactly what was causing my code not to work.
